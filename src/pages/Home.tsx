                Cramming for a big exam can put you under a lot of pressure. This practice can also increase your chances of forgetting almost everything you have studied the night before, especially when you fail to have enough sleep.

                This only means that you must change your study habits and focus on what really matters – preparing before exams. Aside from organizing your preparations for the exam, it would help if you remained consistent with your study time and habits. No matter how busy you are as a student, spending time preparing for important tests is a must!

                India's media and entertainment industries have always been an important part of our national story. As a young nation born in an era where film and radio were in their infancy, we have seen our triumphs and tribulations reflected in the mass media from the very start. These industries have also become important contributors to Indian economic prosperity. In recognition of their importance, the Union government officially designated audiovisual services as one of 12 'champion service sectors' in 2018.
