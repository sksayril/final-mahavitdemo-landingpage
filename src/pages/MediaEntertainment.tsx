              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                India's media and entertainment industries have always been an important part of our national story. As a young nation born in an era where film and radio were in their infancy, we have seen our triumphs and tribulations reflected in the mass media from the very start. These industries have also become important contributors to Indian economic prosperity. In recognition of their importance, the Union government officially designated audiovisual services as one of 12 'champion service sectors' in 2018.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                The sector is witnessing change at breakneck speed â€“ developments in technology, notably the internet and over the top (OTT) content have indelibly changed the creation, distribution and consumption of content. The growing OTT ecosystem offers flexibility to creators and consumers, expands choice, and lowers distribution and search costs. Other developments such as strides in artificial intelligence, virtual reality and augmented reality, are opening up new possibilities in entertainment, creating entirely new categories of products. In its response to these changes, India could potentially propel the sector to new heights and make the country a global leader in entertainment.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                India's media and entertainment (M&E) industry is expected to expand at a CAGR of 3.24% between 2019-20 and 2021-22 to reach US$ 25.56 billion by 2021-22 due to acceleration of digital adoption among users across geographies.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                In December 2020, Star Disney stated that the media & entertainment sector has the potential to increase to ~US$ 100 billion by 2030.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                India's sustained economic growth and the universal acceleration of digital adoption by users across geographies are the two areas that offer encouragement.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                India could be home to a billion digital users by 2028, instead of the earlier projected 2030 timeline, according to KPMG's revised estimates.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                The M&E sector has been substantially affected, by the types of outdoor entertainment coming to a standstill, due to the extended lockdown and slowdown in media spending and supply chain of content. Therefore, it is expected that the M&E sector would contract in FY21 by 20 percentage points with segments such as television, films and print experiencing major declines.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                On the other hand, extended lockdowns accelerated data usage and consumption. Segments such as digital and gaming are seeing rapid growth in user penetration and engagement levels. M&E sector is projected to bounce back in FY22, with the fastest-growing segments being gaming and digital.
